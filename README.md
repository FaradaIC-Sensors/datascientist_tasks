# DataScientist tasks
This repository contains a set of exercises designed for Data Scientist candidates, reflecting routine daily tasks at FaradaIC.
Please complete as many exercises as possible and submit your answers via email with a link to an accessible repository containing both the data and a Jupyter Notebook (or a script with comments) that can be cloned and executed within the same directory.
Based on your evaluation, you may be invited to the next stages of the interview process.
